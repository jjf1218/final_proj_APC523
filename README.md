Final Project Materials for Numerical Algorithms

Three solvers were used to solve the heat equation with time-dependent boundary conditions:
- Explicit Euler
- Implicit Euler
- Crank-Nicolson

There is also an animator function that takes the output of these three solvers and produces movie files
Another code is used for taking the solutions and conducting a timestep analysis

All figures are either in each code directory, or in the plots_from_solvers directory

Final report as a PDF is in the main directory
